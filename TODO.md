# Todo

- [x]  add authentication (we'll use auth0)
- [x]  make it pretty
- [ ]  implement a mechanism to send birthdays and anniversaries to admins
- [ ]  create a mechanism for sending out the bulletin 
- [x] fix slow load of birthdays (some kind of caching)

## dealing with timezones
- [ ] when deployed to render.com it defaults to UTC timezone 
- [ ] should probably allow setting timezone with env vars
